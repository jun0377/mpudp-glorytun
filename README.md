# Glorytun

Glorytun is a small, simple and secure multipath UDP tunnel.

Please use the [stable branch](https://github.com/angt/glorytun/tree/stable).
Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/angt/glorytun/wiki) for how-to guides,
tutorials, etc.

## Features

The key features of Glorytun come directly from [mud](https://github.com/angt/mud).

 * **Fast and highly secure**

   When AES-NI is available, the new and extremely fast AEAD construction
   [AEGIS-256](https://github.com/angt/aegis256) is used.
   Otherwise, an automatic fallback to ChaCha20-Poly1305 is done in both peers.
   All messages are encrypted, authenticated and timestamped to mitigate a
   large set of attacks.
   This implies that the client and the server must be synchronized,
   an offset of 10min is accepted by default.
   Perfect forward secrecy is also implemented with ECDH over Curve25519.
   Keys are rotated every hours.

 * **Multipath and failover**

   Connectivity is now crucial, especially in the SD-WAN world.
   This feature allows a TCP connection (and all other protocols) to explore
   and exploit all available links without being disconnected.
   Aggregation should work on all conventional links.
   Only very high latency (+500ms) links are not recommended for now.
   Backup paths are also supported, they will be used only in case of emergency,
   it is useful when aggregation is not your priority.

 * **Traffic shaping**

   Shaping is very important in network, it allows to keep a low latency
   without sacrificing the bandwidth.
   It also helps the multipath scheduler to make better decisions.
   Currently it must be configured by hand, but soon Glorytun will do it
   for you.

 * **Path MTU discovery without ICMP**

   Bad MTU configuration is a very common problem in the world of VPN.
   As it is critical, Glorytun will try to setup it correctly by guessing
   its value.
   It doesn't rely on Next-hop MTU to avoid ICMP black holes.
   In asymmetric situations the minimum MTU is selected.

## Compatibility

Glorytun only depends on [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)
version >= 1.0.4.
Which can be installed on a wide variety of systems.

Linux is the platform of choice but the code is standard so it should be
easily ported on other posix systems.
It was successfully tested on OpenBSD, FreeBSD and MacOS.

IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
On Linux you can have both at the same time by binding `::`.
